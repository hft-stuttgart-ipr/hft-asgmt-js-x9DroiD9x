# hft-asgmt-js

DO NOT EDIT THE HTML! This is a JS only assignment.

## TODO

- FormValidation:
  - [ ] Listen to `keyup` event on `textarea` and on `input` or on the whole `form`
  - [ ] Username toggles Alert box visible if username length is smaller than 3 chars
  - [ ] Textarea toggles Alert box visible if textarea text length is smaller than 10 chars
  - [ ] If form values are ok, alert box is hidden
  - [ ] OPTIONAL: Enable / Disable the Send button in a similar way the alert box works: Disable if there are errors. Enable if everthing is ok

## Hints

- Alert Box toggling is easiest with adding or removing a class `d-none` is used here! ([https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/display/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/display/))
- Check the `add-entry.html` for the `id` of the form, input or alert elements (so that you can access them via JavaScript)!
